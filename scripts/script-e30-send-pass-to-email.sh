Hello ${SENDER_FIRSTNAME},

Mautic is installed and is already running ! $(if [[ "${SSL_CERTIFICATE,,}" == "test" ]]; then echo "The SSL certificate was installed only as a test!"; fi)$(if [[ "${SSL_CERTIFICATE,,}" != "test" && "${SSL_CERTIFICATE,,}" != "yes" ]]; then echo "No SSL certificate was installed!"; fi)

You can login to Mautic here: https://$MAUTIC_SUBDOMAIN

use username: ${MAUTIC_USERNAME}
and password: ${MAUTIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD}

Attached you can find the file with all the passwords created during installation.

PS: to use the utility commands.php, use the following link:
https://${MAUTIC_SUBDOMAIN}/commands.php
and the password: ${MAUTIC_COMMANDS_PASSWORD}

Have a great day!
