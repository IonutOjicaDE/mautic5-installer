# 🚀 Execution
1. Create an account on [Hetzner](https://ionutojica.ro/hetzner) (or DigitalCloud or AWS or ...) *(If you use my [affiliate link to create a Hetzner account](https://ionutojica.ro/hetzner), you receive 20€ to use them for the server and I receive 10€ to pay for my servers)*
1. Create a VPS that has at minimum 2Gb RAM
    1. On [Hetzner](https://ionutojica.ro/hetzner) you can choose `CX11` as server type
    1. Do not use Keys, but password authentification for `ssh` (you will receive the password from [Hetzner](https://ionutojica.ro/hetzner) per email)
    1. Use `Debian 12` as the Operating System
    1. You can create also a Firewall and let ports 22 (ssh), 80 (http) and 443 (https) for the inside comunication open
1. Connect trough `ssh` to the server (I use [Termius](https://termius.com/))
1. Run as the root user:
    ```sh
    bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IonutOjicaDE/mautic5-installer/main/scripts/mautic-install.sh)
    ```

* the installer will start to update and upgrade the packages, install some needen packages (like php)
* then will automatically download and open the `config file` in the `nano` text editor
* enter your values for each variable inside the config file, save it and exit the editor
* the script will check the values, the errors will be displayed and you will have the possibility to correct them in the text editor
* after no errors are found, a summary will be displayed. That will be the last point to stop the installation
* if you continue, **Mautic 4** will be installed, with all required packages
* all the passwords created will be sent per email
* finish: you can login into Mautic
* enter the credentials from your email service and you cand start sending emails

# ❌ What the installation DOESN'T
To send emails using Mautic, you need Postal, Amazon SES, or simply your SMTP, that actually will send the emails that Mautic prepares.

After the installation is finished, you will need to enter the credentials for Postal, Amazon SES or your SMTP. Without these credentials, Mautic will not be able to send emails.

# ⚙️ Configuration file
The configuration file is `mautic-install.conf` and a template configuration file is downloaded from [github](https://github.com/IonutOjicaDE/mautic5-installer/raw/refs/heads/main/scripts/mautic-install.conf) and will be opened using `nano` text editor (you can find some shortcuts for `nano` below).

| `SSL_CERTIFICATE` | Enter `'yes'` to obtain SSL certificate for production, `'test'` to obtain a test certificate, other value to not obtain any certificate |
| `SEND_PASS_TO_SENDER_EMAIL` | Enter `'yes'` to send the email with created passwords to `SENDER_EMAIL` and to `ADMIN_EMAIL`, other value will not send the email to `SENDER_EMAIL`, only to `ADMIN_EMAIL` |
| `MAUTIC_COUNT` | Commented line: will install first/main instance, values from `2` to `5`: install x count Mautic instance on the same server |
| `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` | if `MAUTIC_COUNT > 1` then we need the password of root user to MySQL database |
| `ROOT_USER_PASSWORD` | if `MAUTIC_COUNT > 1` then we need the password of root user on the server |
| `PHP_VERSION` | Mautic 5.2.4 works with php8.1 well, so enter `'8.1'` |
| `MAUTIC_VERSION` | the last **Mautic 5** version on 31.03.2025 is **5.2.4**, so you could enter `'5.2.4'`. You can check for the last version [here](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/tags). *This installation script is not suitable for Mautic 6!* |
| `ADMINER_VERSION` | the last **AdminerEvo** version on 17.09.2024 is **4.8.4**, so you could enter `'4.8.4'`. You can check for the last version [here](https://github.com/adminerevo/adminerevo). |

# 🖧 VPS
I use VPS from [Hetzner](https://ionutojica.ro/hetzner). `CX11` is more than enough at the begining!

*(If you use my [affiliate link to create a Hetzner account](https://ionutojica.ro/hetzner), you receive 20€ to use them for the server and I receive 10€ to pay for my servers)*

# 📝 Nano text editor
For those that are new to this editor, here are some shortcut keys:

| SHORTCUT | DESCRIPTION |
|--|--|
| `Ctrl+K` | delete current line |
| `Ctrl+S` | save the document |
| `Ctrl+X` | exit nano |
| right click | paste from clipboard |
| `Alt+#` | show line numbers (`Alt+#`=`Alt+Shift+3`) |
| `Alt+$` | wrap long lines (`Alt+$`=`Alt+Shift+4`) |

*I do not use the mouse to change the location of the cursor, but the arrows ond the keyboard. I do not know if nano is compatible with the mouse, for what I do in nano, is for me enough.*

📝 Usually I do like this:
* update the content of the config file in Notepad++ (on Windows)
* copy the content of the file into the Clipboard `Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C`
* when the config file is opened in nano by the script, I press `Ctrl+K` to delete all lines/all content
* then I paste the content from the Clipboard(trough Termius) using `right click`
* save the file pressing `Ctrl+S`
* and exit nano pressing `Ctrl+X`
* the installation script will check your input and continue

I grew up with Windows and mouse and I do not feel myself so comfortable using nano (nor vim). But it is possible :) to work with these tools ✅!

# 🕒 Cronjobs
The main challange was to have the jobs execute each minute and to have them run one after the other, without any parallel executions.

*You want the emails to go out ideally in the next seccond after the subscriber pressed the button. Using independent Forms is almost possible.*

*But using triggers in campaigns or segments, this is not possible. With this script, the emails are sent at least in the next minute. This is acceptable - the subscriber should still be on the "Thank you" page.*

This is done by the file `w-cron-all.sh` which executes `cron-all.php`.

Actually the purpose of all `w-`files is to have all the jobs run one after the other.

## cron-all.php
The actions executed by this cron job are:

| ACTION | SOFT LIMIT | HARD LIMIT | EACH MINUTES | DESCRIPTION |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `webhook:process` | 30 | 110 | 1 | Process webhooks from the queue |
| `email:fetch --message-limit=100` | 30 | 110 | 10 | Check for Replies to emails that were sent |
| `reports:scheduler` | 30 | 110 | 60 | Send the scheduled reports by email |
| `segments:update --batch-limit=1000` | 30 | 110 | 1 | Update Lists / Segments in Mautic |
| `campaigns:rebuild --batch-limit=1000` | 30 | 110 | 1 | Keep campaigns updated with applicable contacts |
| `campaigns:trigger --batch-limit=1000` | 30 | 110 | 1 | Execute campaigns events |
| `broadcasts:send --limit=350` | 59 | 110 | 1 | Send scheduled broadcasts (segment emails) |
| `emails:send --message-limit=360` | 59 | 110 | 1 | Process email queue. If the system configuration is queueing emails, this cron job processes them |
| `import --limit=300` | 59 | 110 | 1 | Import contacts in the background |
| `messages:send` | 59 | 110 | 1 | Send scheduled marketing messages (emails or SMS) |

If the `Soft Limit` is exceeded, then an email will be sent out to the admin with this information.

If the `Hard Limit` is exceeded 5 times, then an email is sent to the admin and the cron jobs are stopped. You should check what is going on before restarting the cronjobs again.

Some jobs are not executed each minute, as these are either resource consuming (like `email:fetch`) or not needed (like `reports:scheduler`).

Some actions are executed only if there is a need for that, like `emails:send` or `import`.

## cron-backup.sh
This job is executed over night and automatically creates backups of the database and Mautic folder. Last 7 backups are kept.

## cron-clear-cache.php
Actually is self explicit: it clears the Mautic cache. This jobs is executed over night. With this cronjob we resolve many issues in Mautic.

## cron-database-optimization.sh
Removes `<style>.cke{visibility:hidden;}</style>` and `<div data-empty="true">` from the emails. These unnecessary code is added by `Froala` editor.

## cron-duplicate.php
You receive an email notification about the contacts found that have same email address (the search is done over night).

## cron-iplookup-download.php
The MaxMind database of the IP-lookup table is updated over night.

## cron-maintenance-cleanup.php
Older informations than 180 days is removed over night.

## reset-mautic-permissions.sh
Actually is self explicit: this job is executed from the crontab of the root user each night. With this cronjob we resolve many issues in Mautic.

## send-email.sh
This job sends the notification emails to the admin about the status of the cronjobs. If all the jobs are performing in limits, no emails are sent.

## DO--RUN
This file acts like a switch. If you rename the file to `DO-NOT-RUN`, then the `cron-all.php` will exit immediatelly.

This is usefull to disable all the cronjobs with a click. The switch is available also from the utility `commands.php` , which executes the file `switchCronJobs.sh` that renames the file from `DO--RUN` to `DO-NOT-RUN` and back.

## cron.lock
This file acts like an invisible signal: if a cronjob is already running, then any other cronjob will not start.

## clear-cache-done
For me was convenient from ssh:
* to just rename the file `clear-cache-done` to `clear-cache`
* to wait for the next execution of `cron-all.php` for:
  * the chache to be cleared
  * the correct permissions to be set
  * the file to be renamed back to `clear-cache-done`

This functionality is still implemented, although the cache can be cleared immediatelly by a click from the utility `commands.php`. Altough by using this file, the cache is cleared after all the cronjobs are executed, meaning no parallel executions are taking place.

# 📁 Folder structure
For the first Mautic instance, these are the folders used:

| FOLDER | DESCRIPTION |
|--|--|
| `/var/www/mautic/` | here is Mautic installed. |
| `/var/www/mautic/commands/` | here is `commands.php` installed |
| `/var/www/mautic/database/` | here is `Adminer` installed |
| `/var/mautic-crons/` | here are the cronjob files that are executed for Mautic |
| `/var/mautic-backups/` | here you can find the backups of the database and Mautic folder |
| `/usr/local/bin/reset-mautic-permissions.sh` | Here is the cronjob that will be executed using root user |

## Further Mautic instances
Here is where the second Mautic instance will be installed. For other Mautic instances will be analog to this.

| FOLDER | DESCRIPTION |
|--|--|
| `/var/www/mautic2/` | here is Mautic2 installed |
| `/var/www/mautic2/commands/` | here is `commands.php` installed |
| `/var/www/mautic2/database/` | here is `Adminer` installed - this has no purpose, as one `Adminer` would be enough on the server. |
| `/var/mautic2-crons/` | here are the cronjob files that are executed for Mautic2 |
| `/var/mautic2-backups/` | here you can find the backups of the database and Mautic2 folder |
| `/usr/local/bin/reset-mautic2-permissions.sh` | Here is the cronjob that will be executed using root user |

# 🛠️ Adminer
`Adminer` will be accessible at https://mautic-subdomain/database/database.php . There you should enter the username (eg. `root`) and the password for the user (the password for the `root` user in MySQL database is saved under `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`).

Some plugins for Adminer are already installed: `edit-textarea`, `file-upload`, `foreign-system`, `tables-filter`, `tinymce`.

# 💻 Commands.php
The utility `commands.php` will be accessible at https://mautic-subdomain/commands/commands.php . You enter the password you received as `MAUTIC_COMMANDS_PASSWORD` and you can choose the command you want to execute. You have also the possibility to personalize the command to execute.

This utility is [open sourced on github](https://github.com/IonutOjicaDE/mautic-commands) and can be updated/downgraded with a click from inside the utility.

Brute force atacks are not working with this utility, because after each wrong password entered, the blocking time is doubled. *This functionality would be great to be included in Mautic and Adminer.*

# 🎥 Live Webinar automation
With this installation you will have a fully functional live webinar automation, meaning all emails, campaigns, forms, segments are there and connected. You have to personalize the emails, insert the form to your landing page, set the date of the next webinar and let the interested contacts subscribe.

The name of these elements (emails, campaigns, forms, segments) is all in Romanian language.

Also all the contact fields inside Mautic are renamed in Romanian language.

# 📋 To do
1. The backup files are located only on the same server as Mautic - this is not good: if the server will be unavailable, the backups will not be accessible anymore. Upload to external cloud is needed, perhaps each 7-th day. [Hetzner](https://ionutojica.ro/hetzner) (or DigitalCloud) can make also backups, but these are also on their servers - it is better to have an external backup also.
1. Include initialization of the VPS on [Hetzner](https://ionutojica.ro/hetzner) (or DigitalCloud). Very usefull information is found here: https://github.com/escopecz/docker-compose-mautic
1. Automatically deduplicate contacts with the same email address. Now you receive only an email notification about the contacts found (the search is done over night).
1. Install only one Adminer. Now each Mautic installation has also an Adminer installed, although one is enough. Adminer is <500kB so this issue is low priority.
1. Possibility to remove installation 2-5. First installation cannot be uninstalled.
1. For those who use Postal, include a variable in the configuration file to autofill the variable `mailer_postal_webhook_signing_key` in the `Config/config.php` in the plugin [MauticPostalServerBundle](https://github.com/IonutOjicaDE/MauticPostalServerBundle).
